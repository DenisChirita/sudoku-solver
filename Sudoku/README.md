This is a Sudoku game. The GUI is created using the Swing Library in Java.
The game implements a sudoku solver algorithm in order to solve any board.
The Sudoku Solver algorithm is using Backtracking and uses bitwise operations. The bitwise operations make the complexity of checking if a number can be placed on the board on a certain square equal to O(1).
